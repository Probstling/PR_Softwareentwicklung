With **transcriptome properties** you can:
- input mRNA sequences in FASTA file format
- calculate sequence specific features like
    - Length of 5'UTR, CDS and 3'UTR
    - Exon junction density
    - GC content
    - Codon frequency
    - Most frequent start and stop codon
    - Kozak strength
- get information about secondary structures like
    - Motiv analysis
    - Secondary structure predictions
    - Opening energies
- recive statistical evaluation of the genecode human reference transcriptomes
